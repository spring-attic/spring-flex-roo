     * <p>
     * This method resolves the issue that a {@link ActionScriptType} is location independent, yet
     * {@link ASPhysicalTypeIdentifier} instances are location dependent (ie a {@link ASPhysicalTypeIdentifier} relates
     * to a given physical file, whereas a {@link ActionScriptType} simply assumes the type is available from the
     * classpath). This resolution is achieved by first scanning the {@link PathResolver#getSourcePaths()} locations,
     * and then scanning any locations provided by the {@link ClasspathProvidingProjectMetadata} (if the
     * {@link ProjectMetadata} implements this extended interface).
     * 
     * <p>
     * Due to the "best effort" basis of classpath resolution, callers should not rely on complex classpath resolution
     * outcomes. However, callers can rely on robust determination of types defined in {@link Path}s from
     * {@link PathResolver#getSourcePaths()}, using the {@link Path} order returned by that method.
     *

     * @return the string (in {@link ASPhysicalTypeIdentifier} format) if found, or null if not found
